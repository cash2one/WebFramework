The basic startup flow looks like this:
1. A user requests the first page of your application
2. The user's browser makes an HTTP connection to your server and loads the in
dex.html page containing your template.
3. Angular loads into the page, waits for the page to be fully loaded, and then looks
for ng-app to define its template boundaries.
4. Angular traverses the template and looks for directives and bindings. This results
in registration of listeners and DOM manipulation, as well as fetching initial data
from the server. The end result of this work is that the app is bootstrapped and the
template is converted into view as a DOM.
5. You connect to your server to load additional data you need to show the user as
needed.
